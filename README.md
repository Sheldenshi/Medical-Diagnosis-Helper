Medical Diagnosis Helper
=============================

The aim of this project is to build a tool that could help doctors and patients to find medical resources that are informative for individual cases effectively. Our [last release V1.0](#version-1.0) could save doctors or patients hours to read through loosely related papers(see Releases for more details).



This project is built using React frontend and Flask backend.
